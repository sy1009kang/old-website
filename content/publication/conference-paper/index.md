### Overview
In this paper, we investigate how users' personality traits and the specific context of their collaboration influence their choices and social expectations for avatar-mediated identity representation. 

Key contributions include:
- Analysis of social norms in professional vs. casual VR environments.
- Correlation between Big Five personality traits and avatar preference.
- Design implications for future expressive avatar systems.
